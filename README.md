## Implementation Plan
After pitching the idea and receiving approval, I created a Trello board using a Kanban template. 
From here, I listed out the main tasks that needed to completed in prioritised order and added a checklist to further breakdown each task. The below screenshot shows the main screen of my Trello board, and I've included a printed version of the board that shows the checklist items.
